CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a table in a database. 
Database tables are organized into rows and columns. 
Each table must have a name and can have any number of columns (minimum 1 column is required). 
Each column must have a data type which determines the type of values that can be stored. 
CREATE TABLE command will fail if a table is already existing in the database with the same name. 
All tables must have a unique name.

DROP TABLE statement is used to remove an existing table from the database.
DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table from the database.
The syntax for DROP statement:
        DROP TABLE <Table name>;
Note:- Tables without any reference with the child table can be dropped using the DROP statement given above.

The parent table in the database cannot be deleted before deleting all its child tables basically the tables with which its foreign keys are associated with.

DROP TABLE <Table name> CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
CASCADE CONSTRAINTS clause should be added to the DROP statement to drop all the referential integrity constraints that refer to primary and unique keys in the table.

Table level constraint can be specified after all columns used in the constraint have been defined. 
It is not necessary to specify them after all columns in the table are defined. 
Composite constraints can only be specified as table level constraints.

Various constraints that can be created on database tables are:
NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, CHECK, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY
We can also specify DEFAULT value for a column. Oracle database does not consider DEFAULT as a constraint.

NOT NULL Constraint prevents a column from accepting NULL values. 
NOT NULL can only be applied as a column level constraint. 
Constraint name is optional and it can be specified by using CONSTRAINT keyword.

A column can be given the default value by using DEFAULT option. 
The data type of column and default expression must be the same. 
DEFAULT option can be provided for nullable as well as NOT NULL attributes. 
Oracle database does not consider DEFAULT as a constraint.

PRIMARY KEY constraint on a column ensures that the column cannot contain NULL and duplicate values. 
We can have only one PRIMARY KEY in a table.

UNIQUE constraint on a column ensures that two rows in a table cannnot have same value in that column. 
Unlike Primary Key, UNIQUE constraint allows NULL values. A table can have many UNIQUE constraints.

We need to use ALTER TABLE command through which the structure of the existing table can be changed without any loss of data. 
It can also be used to rename a column, change the data type of a column and to add or remove constraints.
